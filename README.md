Project brief:

> 107. How well can the gender of Twitter users be predicted?
> There are different Twitter datasets. They contain information about twitter users (e.g. date of registration, tweet count) and often the users´ gender. Based on the user´s features, how well can their gender be predicted, and which features are particularly predictive?
